        Pre-Engineered Buildings (PEBs) can be referred to as structures whose
        components are made in a factory and then assembled together at a
        certain location. Usually, the PEBs are quite distinct in comparison to
        the traditional structural steel buildings, and they can be an ideal
        alternative. While the different elements of the PEBs are designed as
        per the design specifications, they are transported to the construction
        site and later assembled at the site using bolts. When you come across
        this structural concept, it is usually used to build storage units,
        warehouses, and manufacturing buildings. The use of the PEBs comprise of
        the structural steel framing system, wall panels, and the metal roofing
        system.

        summary="As soon as the drawing is approved, a company can expect the delivery
        of the components within a few weeks. In addition, the anchor bolts
        and foundation are made parallelly along with the final preparations,
        thereby making these ready for bolting at the premises. Such kind of
        buildings help to reduce the overall construction time span when
        compared to the usual building structures. Subsequently, this offers
        the owner to generate revenue and allow for quick occupancy."

In case of the pre-engineered structures, the columns are made with the help of Isections. After observing the columns, these expand across the width and the depth as you start moving towards the top of the column."

Both, the top flange and the bottom flange are placed to form the roof slope. Every flange also has a stiffener lip which is 24 mm in thickness."

While such type of sheets are made from steel coils, the thickness ranges from 0.47 mm to 0.8 mm, along with high-tensile properties. But, when the roof is designed, the main objective is that the panels must sustain the snow loads and the cyclone. As the designers develop the panels, they design it as per the standards of ASTM A792M Grade 340/550 MPA. Besides, the panels are also coated with Galvalume which is an alloy with 55% Aluminum and 42.5% Zinc. Usually, these panels are available in thicknesses, 0.475 mm, 0.50 mm, 0.55 mm, and 0.76 mm and in different colors."
